# Google-Apprenticeship-Prep-Roadmap-2025-

📘 Google Apprenticeship Prep Roadmap (2025)
1️⃣ Understand the Hiring Phases

Screen → Online coding + resume/application review

Interview → Coding, problem solving, light system design, Googliness

Decide → Overall evaluation

👉 Goal: You need strong DSA + clear communication + basic system design + teamwork mindset.

2️⃣ Core Coding Prep (Daily Practice)
🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (must-know)

Arrays & Strings → sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums

Linked Lists → reverse, detect cycle, merge

Hash Tables / Sets → frequency maps, lookups

Trees & Graphs → BFS, DFS, shortest path (BFS/Dijkstra basics), recursion

Sorting & Searching → quicksort, mergesort, binary search

Dynamic Programming → subsequence problems (LCS, LIS, knapsack)

📌 Action Plan:

Solve 1-2 LeetCode Easy/Medium daily

Mix topics: do 5 arrays, then 5 strings, then 5 trees, etc.

Keep a notes doc for patterns → this will be your revision sheet.

Resources:

LeetCode Patterns

HackerRank Interview Prep Kit

Neetcode.io (excellent curated roadmap)

3️⃣ System Design Basics (for interviews)

Not full-blown design like senior SWE, but you should know:

Client-server model

REST APIs (how they work, status codes)

Database design basics (tables, primary key, indexing)

Caching (e.g., Redis basics)

Scalability → load balancer, replication basics

📌 Action Plan:

Read System Design Primer
 (intro sections only)

Practice explaining how you’d design a simple URL shortener or ToDo app

4️⃣ Programming Language Focus

Pick one primary language (Python or Java recommended).

Python Focus:

Practice writing clean, readable functions

Learn collections module (Counter, defaultdict, heapq)

OOP basics: classes, inheritance

File handling, exceptions

Java Focus:

Learn Collections API (ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet)

OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)

Exception handling & streams

📌 Don’t try to master all 4 languages → focus on 1 solid + be aware of others.

5️⃣ Git & Collaboration Skills

Google values teamwork + collaboration.

Learn basic GitHub workflows: clone, commit, branch, PR

Try one small open-source contribution (even documentation counts!)

Document your code (docstrings, README.md)

6️⃣ Communication & “Googliness”

During interviews:

Talk out loud while coding → show how you’re thinking

Ask clarifying questions → shows problem-solving maturity

Be positive, curious, collaborative

📌 Practice mock interviews:

Pramp (free peer interviews)

Interviewing.io (sometimes free mock interviews with real engineers)

7️⃣ Resume & Application Review

Since this is an apprenticeship (not a senior SWE role):

Highlight projects (web apps, small games, automation scripts, open source)

Show learning ability → online courses, certifications, hackathons

Mention teamwork/collaboration (college projects, GitHub collabs)

8️⃣ 8-Week Prep Plan (Sample Schedule)

Week 1-2 → Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Linked Lists (LeetCode Easy/Medium)
Week 3-4 → Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching
Week 5 → Dynamic Programming basics + review past topics
Week 6 → System Design basics + REST APIs + databases
Week 7 → Mock interviews (Pramp, friends, ChatGPT roleplay)
Week 8 → Review notes + final polish (resume, GitHub profile, projects)

✅ If you follow this plan, you’ll be ready for:

Technical screen (DSA + problem solving)

Interviews (clear thought process + system design basics)

Application (resume + projects that show learning ability)

Would you like me to create a daily/weekly detailed study schedule (with resources + exact LeetCode problems) so you can just follow it step by step till interview?

Perfect 👍 I’ll build you a Daily/Weekly Google Apprenticeship Study Schedule (8 weeks).
This plan balances DSA practice, system design basics, projects, and communication skills.

📅 8-Week Google Apprenticeship Prep Schedule (2025)
Week 1: Arrays & Strings (Foundations)

Goal: Build strong base + get used to problem-solving format.

DSA (LeetCode Easy/Medium – 2 per day)

Two Sum

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Valid Anagram

Group Anagrams

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Maximum Subarray

Concepts: Time complexity (O, Ω, Θ), Big-O for loops/nested loops.

Extra: Start keeping a “Problem-Solving Notes” doc → write approach + edge cases.

📌 Resources: Neetcode Arrays & Strings playlist

Week 2: Linked Lists, Hashing, Stacks, Queues

Goal: Learn how to handle pointers + data lookup.

DSA Problems:

Reverse Linked List

Merge Two Sorted Lists

Linked List Cycle

LRU Cache (use hashmap + doubly linked list)

Valid Parentheses (stack)

Min Stack

Concepts: Hashmaps, Sets, Stack/Queue operations

System Design: What is an API? Example of REST API call.

📌 Project Idea: Build a small To-Do CLI app in Python/Java with add/remove tasks. Use GitHub.
